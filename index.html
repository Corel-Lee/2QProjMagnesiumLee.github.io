    <!-- Introduction paragraph -->
    <p id = "introParagraph">
        The website will cover the history of wrist beater watches or watches that the working class
        used. Wrist beater watches are watches worn while doing heavy work because of their unmatched
        durability compared to other watches. Inexpensive and reliable, these watches served the working
        class by telling when lunch started and when they can go home. Some of these watches do not need a
        battery to operate, can withstand the entire weight of a truck while ticking, and could
        tell the time for over 10 years with a single battery.<br>
        <br>
        This subset of watches has a colorful history starting at the mid-20th century to the present and
        have world-wide influence containing stories from America all the way to Japan. The website doesn't
        only focus on the history of these watches but will also cover topics like engineering, economics,
        and advertising which are found in the complex history of these watches.</p>
