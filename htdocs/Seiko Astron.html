    Seiko is a Japanese watch company known for the movement or technology hidden deep within their watches.
    Today the company is most known for its complicated mechanical and automatic watch movements, and the
    artistic design of their watch dials. However, historically Seiko is known for producing the first ever wrist
    watch implemented with a quartz movement which changed and revolutionized the watch industry.</p><br>

    <p class = "contents" style = "margin-top: 50px;">To explain the impact of the technology Seiko developed, knowing the technology before
    quartz is essential. Mechanical watch movements involved many moving parts. The crown of the watch had to be
    wound which gave a small spring in the watch limited amounts of stored energy which was transferred to several
    gears inside the watch and those gears would make the hands of the watch move, telling the time. Automatic watch
    movements worked in the same fashion, but instead of winding a crown manually, the watch had a rotor inside the watch.
    The rotor would move along with the momentum of the wearer’s arm, which would make the rotor spin on a pivot connected
    to the spring of the watch which powered the mechanisms. The downside of these movements is that the watch had to be
    powered up every morning as it lost power during the night, and due to many possibilities of error in the movement,
    these watches were not very accurate in telling the time. These watches also had to be handmade out of precious gems and metals
    by expert watch makers to produce a good quality movement.</p>

    <p class = "contents" style = "margin-top: 220px;">Quartz movements rely on a battery-powered oscillator which sends electric signals to a tiny
    piece of quartz making the latter vibrate at a rate of 32,768 hertz or 2^15 hertz. An electric circuit then measures
    the 32,768 Hz and translates that vibration into one electric signal which powers a motor to move the hands of the clock.
    Since the electric circuits translates 32,768 cycles a second into one signal, the seconds hand of the watch moves once
    every second. This entire process makes the watch tell time very accurately and reliably due to the specific cycles of the watch.
    Being made out of electric circuits, and quartz, which is the second most abundant mineral on the planet, quartz movements can be
    mass produced in factories, unlike mechanical and automatic watches which required the hand craft of, usually of Swiss descent,
    watch makers, and several precious metals and gems composing the movement.</p>


    <p class ="contents" style = "margin-top: 100px;">Quartz movements, descending from the technology of the Seiko Astron, dominated the watch market for being
    easily produced, reliable, and accurate. Many Japanese watch brands, like Casio and Citizen, soon followed suit with Seiko, mass
    producing quartz watches and exporting them world-wide. This destroyed the Swiss watch industry known for their mechanical and
    automatic movements. Less and less people were buying mechanical and automatic watches as practical tools due to their costliness
    and fragility, and were instead buying more inexpensive quartz watches. Due to this, hundreds of professional watch makers lost
    their jobs, and mechanical and automatic watches today are mostly seen as pieces of jewelry instead of tools.</p>
