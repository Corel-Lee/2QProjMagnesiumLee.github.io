    <p class= "contents" style = "margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 150px;">Casio G-Shock is one of the most respected watch brands in the industry due to its sheer design and
    durability which are entirely unique to the brand. <br><br>The story of the G-Shock starts with Kikuo Ibe. One day he accidentally
    dropped a pocket watch given to him by his father which consequently broke the entire watch. Due to this accident, he wanted
    to design a watch that was indestructible. To guide the creation of the project, Ibe came up with the triple 10 resistance
    rule, which was to represent the 3 factors the watch needed to have: 10-year battery life, 10 bar water resistance, and 10-meter
    drop survival. To accompany him, Ibe chose 3 individuals to help him design the project and they were known as Team Tough.</p>

    <p class = "contents" style = "margin-top: 190px; margin-bottom: 150px;">Over 200 prototypes for the concept were used and none of them were successful. Ibe’s
    eureka moment came when he visited a playground and observed children playing with a rubber ball. He realized that an
    object in the center of a rubber ball wouldn’t sustain any damage from any outside force due to the absorption of force
    the outside layers of rubber will do. So, he implemented this concept in a prototype and released the first ever G-Shock
    DW-5000C in 1983. </p>

    <p class = "contents" style = "margin-bottom: 150px;">Sales in Japan were not very high as the Japanese watch market was more focused into dress watches
    rather than durable watches. To promote G-Shock outside of Japan, Casio released a commercial in America where a hockey
    player struck a G-Shock like it was a hockey puck to later show that the watch survived the impact of the hit, proving
    its durability. Although impressive, the commercial was not well-received due to the criticisms of the commercial being
    unrealistic or misleading. However, an experiment done by a news channel where they hit the watch multiple times with a
    hockey stick like advertised, showed that the G-Shock was able to sustain such abuse. Because of this experiment, the sales
    for G-Shock watches rose, gaining the trust of consumers,
    selling over 19 million units by 1998, and 100 million shipments in 2017.</p>

    <p class = "contents" style = "margin-bottom: 50px;">The watch has been used by the military, paramedics, and law enforcement as tools. The G-Shock has been
    certified to be used in spaceflight by N.A.S.A. making the G-Shock one of the most worn watches in space. With the ability
    to change the color of the resin of the watch, the G-Shock has become a fashion icon throughout the years, appearing often
    in pop culture. To further prove the watch’s durability, Casio took on a challenge no watch manufacturer has taken before.
    In 2017, Casio attempted the Guinness World Record for the heaviest vehicle to drive over a watch. The G-Shock sustained the
    weight of the 25-metric ton truck and was able to keep its functions as normal, further proving its reliability and durability.</p>
